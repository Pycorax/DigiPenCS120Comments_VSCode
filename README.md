# DigiPen CS120 Comments Visual Studio Code Extension

A simple Visual Studio Code extension that provides auto-completion hooks for generating file and function level comments styled to DigiPen Singapore's CS120 requirements. This is my first VS Code Extension and Node.JS with TypeScript project. I'm learning it as I work on this so the style might not be optimal.

Based on Microsoft's VS Code Completion extension sample here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/completions-sample
